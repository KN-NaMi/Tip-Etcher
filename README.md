# Tip Etcher for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)

## Overview
This project is a **Tip Etcher** designed for the fabrication of fine tungsten tips required for **Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)**. The inspiration for this project comes from the [Zyrus Tip Etcher](https://hackaday.io/project/191941-zyrus-tip-etcher-for-scanning-tunneling-microscopy) project, with modifications to improve performance and usability.
